#Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project

Introduction

This repository contains project code for the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning data" course of the "Data Science Specialization" track.

#Data

The data comes from experiments carried on a group of 30 volunteers with the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 
The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================
- 'README.txt'
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
The following files are available for the train and test data.

The run_analysis.R which will merge the test and training sets together, adds labels and create a tidy data set containing the means of all the columns per test subject and per activity. 

The CodeBook.md file explains the process followed.
